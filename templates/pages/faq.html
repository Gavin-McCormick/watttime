<h2>The Details</h2>
</br>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-info text-info">
<blockquote><p class="text-info">What is WattTime?</p></blockquote>
<p class="text-info">WattTime helps you take control of the energy sources that power your own electricity consumption. Similar to many municipal information systems, WattTime uses a text message notification service to inform you when your energy source is particularly dirty or particularly clean.</p>

<blockquote><p class="text-info">How does it work?</p></blockquote>
<p class="text-info">Most modern electricity markets in America are run like giant auctions, with power traded in a single market across large regions. WattTime tracks goings-on in these markets in real time, bringing you information about the current sources of power in different markets, so you can decide whether it's a good time to buy power. Future versions will track more precise details about these markets, bringing you ever greater flexibility and impact in your ability to have a say in how these markets work.</p>

<blockquote><p class="text-info">What does the service cost?</p></blockquote>
<p class="text-info">WattTime does not charge users to receive energy status notifications or to send replies to WattTIme. Please note that the current version of WattTime does send occasional text messages (you control the frequency), and if you pay to receive and send text messages, normal rates may apply. Please check with your carrier.</p>

<blockquote><p class="text-info">Are you available in my region?</p></blockquote>
<p class="text-success">Currently we are in closed beta in California and Massachusetts. If you'd like to be notified when we are available in your state, just sign up on our main page! In the meantime, if you live in California, New England, or the Pacific Northwest, you can still see how clean electricity is in your are at any time by visiting our <a href="{% url 'status' %}">status</a> page.</p>

<blockquote><p class="text-info">How do I unsubscribe or change my settings?</p></blockquote>
<p class="text-info">To change your settings, including unsubscribing, just <a href="{% url 'user_login' %}">log in</a> and edit your preferences.</p>

<blockquote><p>What's your privacy policy?</p></blockquote>
<p>We believe that rigorous scientific research and people-centered design can be an important tool in the fight against climate change. We do collect anonymous user data and may eventually publish any important findings in scientific journals. But we take that anonymity seriously. We will never, ever, sell, share or publish any individually identifiable information without your explicit consent. That includes your contact information - no spam here.</p>

<blockquote><p>Are you a private company?</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now we are just a small group of dedicated individuals trying to do some good in the world on our own time. We may eventually incorporate if we conclude that is the best way to ensure that we can continue to make our service relevant and effective. But our top priority is and will remain to help energy consumers make decisions according to their own values. We believe that when people can freely choose their energy sources it can have a big impact in the fight against climate change.</p>

<blockquote><p>Why do you need pilot testing?</p></blockquote>
<p>Every good product and service needs prototyping, iteration, and testing to be the best it can be. As far as we have been able to determine, this is a fundamentally novel approach to fighting climate change. While ours is not the first project to give users real-time information about the cleanliness of electricity, our approach is fundamentally different “under the hood” because it leverages marginal rather than average electricity information, dramatically increasing the impact of your actions. (See our How It Works for details.) While our novel design works according to economic theory, we never fully trust theory until it is backed up by hard data and experience. (And neither should you!) Our pilot testing and research will help validate the concept and provide critical insight for scaling WattTime to improve energy futures for millions of users.</p>

<blockquote><p>What are your future plans?</p></blockquote>
<p>Text messages are just one source of information that can trigger dynamic shifts in our energy consumption habits. We know many Americans have both the motivation and the ability to make a lasting, positive impact on our future energy security. That’s why we are working to build even more convenient ways for you to find out and leverage precise, meaningful about your regional energy status. With these additional capabilities, we aim to increase your choices and convenience for taking control of your own energy future.</p>

<blockquote><p>Why do you want to know about my appliances?</p></blockquote>
<p>Our goal is to give you maximum control over the environmental impacts of your own energy use in as convenient a fashion as possible.  Different kinds of appliances are convenient to control in different ways - for example sometimes laundry can wait until tomorrow, but you probably wouldn’t want to turn off your thermostat for a whole day!  The more we know about your appliances, the more convenient our messaging can be, and the more relevant to you. But we’re only asking to help tailor your experience. If you’d rather not tell us about your particular equipment, you are welcome to opt for the generic messages instead.</p>

<blockquote><p>What’s the difference between the different goals?</p></blockquote>
<p>There are lots of ways you can use electricity timing to help the environment. We currently offer three settings (with more coming soon):
<br>
1) Help renewable energy! Get texts when you’re running on renewable power, and it’s a really clean time to use electricity.
<br>
2) Start going coal-free! Get texts when your power is coming from coal, so you can know when to use less electricity.
<br>
3) Maximize your immediate impact on climate change! Get texts about both the cleanest (renewable or nuclear) and the dirtiest (coal or oil) times.
Or if you can’t decide, you can always just let us choose and see what you get!</p>

<blockquote><p>I signed up for texts about once per (hour/day/week), but I haven’t gotten exactly that number. What gives?</p></blockquote>
<p>We contact you when the grid is particularly clean or dirty, but of course we can't control exactly when that will be. In fact the electricity fuel mix can actually be quite unpredictable, depending on everything from weather to the market strategies different power plant operators employ. (Otherwise we could just hand out calendars!) We’ll do our best not to text you more than about the amount you signed up for, but it may be that the grid has been pretty boring lately and there’s not much to report! You can always see the recent status at our <a href="{% url 'status' %}">grid status page</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I’m having a problem. How do I troubleshoot?</p></blockquote>
<p>You can reach us via the <a href="{% url 'contact'%}">contact page</a>. We’re happy to help!</p>
