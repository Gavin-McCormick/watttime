            We will never, ever, sell, share or publish any individually identifiable
            information without your explicit consent. That includes your contact
            information—no spam here. We do collect anonymous user data and may eventually
            publish any important findings in scientific journals. We believe that rigorous
            scientific research and people-centered design can be an important tool in the
            fight against climate change. But we take anonymity seriously!

            Right now we are just a small group of dedicated individuals trying todo some
            good in the world on our own time. We may eventually incorporate if we conclude
            that is the best way to ensure that we can continue to make our service relevant
            and effective. But our top priority is and will remain to help energy consumers
            make decisions according to their own values. We believe that when people can
            freely choose their energy sources it can have a big impact in the fight against
            climate change.

            Every good product and service needs prototyping, iteration, and testing to be
            the best it can be. As far as we have been able to determine, this is a
            fundamentally novel approach to fighting climate change. While ours is not the
            first project to give users information about the cleanliness of electricity,
            our approach is fundamentally different “under the hood” because it leverages
            real-time marginal rather than average environmental information, dramatically
            increasing the impact of your actions. While our novel design works according to
            economic theory, we never fully trust theory until it is backed up by hard data
            and experience. (And neither should you!) Our pilot testing and research will help
            validate the concept and provide critical insight for scaling WattTime to improve
            energy futures for millions of users.

            WattTime Alerts is free! Please note however that WattTime Alerts can
            send occasional text messages (you control the frequency), so if you pay to
            receive and send text messages, normal rates may apply. Please check with your
            carrier.

            Currently Alerts by SMS are available in California and New England (Massachusetts,
            Conneticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine).
            Forecast Alerts by email are also available in California.
            If you'd like to be notified when we are available in your state,
            just sign up on our main page!
            In the meantime, if you live in California, New England, or the Pacific Northwest,
            you can still see how clean electricity is in your region at any time by visiting
            our <a href="{% url 'status' %}">status</a> page.

            Our goal is to give you maximum control over the environmental impacts of your
            own energy use in as convenient a fashion as possible. Different kinds of
            appliances are convenient to control in different ways—for example sometimes
            laundry can wait until tomorrow, but you probably wouldn’t want to turn off your
            thermostat for a whole day! The more we know about your appliances, the more
            convenient our messaging can be, and the more relevant to you. But we’re only
            asking to help tailor your experience. If you’d rather not tell us about your
            particular equipment, you are welcome to opt for the generic messages instead.

            We contact you when the grid is particularly clean or dirty,
            but of course we can't control exactly when that will be. In fact the electricity
            fuel mix can be quite unpredictable, depending on everything from weather to the
            strategies of different power plants. (Otherwise we could just hand out calendars!)
            We’ll do our best not to text you more than about the amount you signed up for,
            but some days the grid is pretty average all day and there’s just not much to
            report. You can always see the recent status at our grid
