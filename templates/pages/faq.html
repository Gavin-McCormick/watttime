		<p class="text-info">WattTime helps you make informed decisions about energy use. Similar to many municipal information systems, WattTime uses a text message notification service to inform you when your energy source is particularly dirty or particularly clean. Coming soon: other services to give you even more control over where your power comes from.</p>

      <div class="accordion-inner">
<p class="text-info">Most modern electricity markets in America are run like giant auctions, with power traded in a single market across large regions. WattTime tracks goings-on in these markets in real time, bringing you information about the current sources of power in different markets. That way you can decide whether it's a good time to buy power by using electricity (e.g. by running the dishwasher, charging your electronic devices, or turning on a power strip). Future versions will track more precise details about these markets, bringing you ever greater flexibility and impact in your ability to have a say in how these markets work.</p>

<p class="text-info">Right now we are just a small group of dedicated individuals trying to do some good in the world on our own time. We may eventually incorporate if we conclude that is the best way to ensure that we can continue to make our service relevant and effective. But our top priority is and will remain to help energy consumers make decisions according to their own values. We believe that when people can freely choose their energy sources it can have a big impact in the fight against climate change.</p>

<p class="text-info">Every good product and service needs prototyping, iteration, and testing to be the best it can be. As far as we have been able to determine, this is a fundamentally novel approach to fighting climate change. While ours is not the first project to give users information about the cleanliness of electricity, our approach is fundamentally different “under the hood” because it leverages real-time marginal rather than average environmental information, dramatically increasing the impact of your actions. While our novel design works according to economic theory, we never fully trust theory until it is backed up by hard data and experience. (And neither should you!) Our pilot testing and research will help validate the concept and provide critical insight for scaling WattTime to improve energy futures for millions of users.</p>

We know many Americans have both the motivation and the ability to make a lasting, positive impact on our future energy security.

<p class="text-info">Our goal is to give you maximum control over the environmental impacts of your own energy use in as convenient a fashion as possible.  Different kinds of appliances are convenient to control in different ways - for example sometimes laundry can wait until tomorrow, but you probably wouldn’t want to turn off your thermostat for a whole day!  The more we know about your appliances, the more convenient our messaging can be, and the more relevant to you. But we’re only asking to help tailor your experience. If you’d rather not tell us about your particular equipment, you are welcome to opt for the generic messages instead.</p>

<p class="text-info">We contact you when the grid is particularly clean or dirty, but of course we can't control exactly when that will be. In fact the electricity fuel mix can be quite unpredictable, depending on everything from weather to the strategies of different power plants. (Otherwise we could just hand out calendars!) We’ll do our best not to text you more than about the amount you signed up for, but some days the grid is pretty average all day and there’s just not much to report.
