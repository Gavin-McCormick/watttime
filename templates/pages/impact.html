                    Our software can show users how much of their region's power currently comes 
                    from clean renewable sources, the only way to shift demand towards
                    inframarginal renewable fuel sources.

                    Users can see the current marginal fuel source in their region, allowing them
                    to shift demand towards cleaner conventional fuels such as hydropower and
                    biomass away from dirty sources such as coal and oil. (Currently
                    implemented in New England only; additional regions coming soon).

                By combining open data with automated real-time economic analysis, it should
                soon be possible for our users to also time electricity to take advantage of
                many more powerful strategies.
                (These ones are currently under development by
                our crack team of economists and data analysts from UC Berkeley, MIT, and the

                <p>
                    By exploiting wind power oversupply, users in select locations will be
                    able to reduce emissions by up to 100% at optimal times.

                <p>
                    Through automation of select devices, users will be able to use energy at
                    times which exploit minor spikes in the availability of renewable energy,
                    making renewable energy more competitive with fossil power plants.

                <h3>Reduced ramping</h3>
                <p>
                    With automation, users can even reduce pollution from traditional power
                    plants by allowing them to reduce wasteful episodes of turning up and down
                    repeatedly.

                    suggest this technique can reduce power plant emissions by up to 25%.
