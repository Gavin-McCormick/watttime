                    If you had a choice, would you care what kind of power fuels our nation? 
                    Clean power like solar and wind, or aging fossil fuel plants?

			<p>
                        Every day, hundreds of power plants compete to sell you power. 
                        At WattTime, we think it's time you had a say in who wins.
