<h2>How WattTime Works</h2><br>
<div class="well">
<p>Imagine going into a shoe store and trying to buy shoes without being able to see what's inside the shoe boxes. Some days it's all hiking boots, other days high heels. If you didn't know what shoes you were buying, you'd probably take your business somewhere else! And yet for most of us, that’s what buying electricity is like. When you flip a light switch, what are you getting—solar power? Coal? You probably have opinions about what power source you’d prefer if you had a choice.</p>

<p>With WattTime, you can finally know what fuel you’re getting. Check out our real-time <a href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~stansife/watttime/">graphs</a> of the electricity grid in New England. You’ll see that the answer varies a lot from time to time! And sometimes it’s unpredictable. So we also offer a text message notification service. To avoid you having to check the website constantly, we can notify you when your fuel meets the criteria you’d like to be notified about—like, when it’s probably going to be the cleanest point of the week, or days when you’re running on coal.</p> 

<p>And what to do with this information? We spend a lot of time thinking about small, easy ways to make a big impact with your fuel choices. We’ll send you helpful hints with our texts and can personalize them to ways that are convenient for you in particular to make a big impact on the issues you tell us you care about. Do you have air conditioning and want to encourage renewable energy? We’ll let you know on days when pre-cooling your house would mean you could cool with renewable power. And if you like, you can text us back and help us measure our impact and improve the quality of our hints.</p>
