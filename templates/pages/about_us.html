        <p>
            Our vision is simple: empower people to control their own energy choices,
            based on their own values, instead of leaving those choices up to power companies. By combining
            groundbreaking new techniques in energy economics with emerging sources of real-time grid data, that
            vision of energy choice is becoming a reality. Now everyone can have a say in the emerging clean energy
            economy.

                        Founder Gavin McCormick and technical co-founder Anna Schneider met at the 2013 Berkeley Cleanweb
                        Hackathon and have been having a great time working on WattTime ever since.
                        We love spending every day combining our skills from graduate research at UC Berkeley
                        (Gavin in behavioral and energy economics, Anna in computational biophysics),
                        our professional experience in the energy sector, and our joy in doing
                        big things with teams of talented, dedicated, and friendly folks.
                        I would say that you can also find us in the woods working on our treefort,
                        but you probably couldn't—we'll have to take you there sometime.

                        WattTime's stellar developers, designers, and buildings engineers may be split between
                        the Bay Area and London,
                        but we're connected by our passion for crafting ever more powerful, easy, and fun ways
                        to use cleaner energy (and by our love of Indian food).

                        Energy markets are complex beasts. WattTime's world-class economists and analysts have the
                        technical chops to spend our days wading through the data,
                        and the domain expertise to know when we've discovered a new way to make a real-world difference.
                        Our motto: we can do better.
