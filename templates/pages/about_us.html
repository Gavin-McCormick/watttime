        WattTime was founded in 2013 by UC Berkeley economics PhD student Gavin McCormick 
        with a simple vision: empower people to control their energy choices, based on their own values, 
        instead of leaving those choices up to energy companies. By combining groundbreaking new 
        techniques in energy economics with emerging sources of real-time grid data, that vision of energy 
        choice is becoming a reality. Ordinary people can now have a say in the future of the clean energy economy.
  <br><br>
            At WattTime, we spend our days crafting new tools and practices that make energy choices 
            easier, cheaper, and more empowering for everyday life. Our goal is to reduce friction in the clean energy economy 
            by testing and implementing the best research in sustainability, social science, and interaction design. 
      <br><br>
            You can get involved too! The easiest way to participate is to <a href="{% url 'home' %}">sign up for WattTime here</a>. 
            We would also love to get your feedback about how it works for you, what experiences you have, 
            and how it makes you feel. If you'd like to participate in a survey of your experiences, 
            please check the participate box in your account preferences. And if all that's not enough 
            and you share our passion for placing the power of energy choice in people's 
            hands, please <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">get in touch!</a><br><br>
            We are a small but passionate team of social scientists, software developers, designers, and 
            cleantech professionals based in the San Francisco Bay Area. If you are 
            an energy industry professional, front-end or mobile developer, 
            digital illustrator, filmmaker, or mechanical engineer, we would especially love to hear from you.
