<p>
WattTime was founded in 2013 by UC Berkeley economist Gavin McCormick.
Gavin had a simple vision: a world where everyone is empowered to make
choices about energy usage based on their personal values and
priorities. We're still in alpha, but we're already creating buzz
at Bay Area hackathons:

WattTime is a small team of passionate coders, designers, and cleantech
professionals based in the SF Bay Area. Between us, we have [xx] years
of graduate education at UC Berkeley (studying everything financial
engineering to photosynthesis) and [xx] years of experience
in the energy sector (at DOE, 3TIER, the Institute for the Future, and
more). If you want to help us build great products that launch the
clean energy economy, <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">get in touch</a>!
