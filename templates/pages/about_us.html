            WattTime was founded in 2013 by UC Berkeley economics PhD student Gavin McCormick 
            with a simple vision: empower people to take control of their own energy choices, 
            based on their own values, instead of leaving those choices up to the energy companies. 
            By combining groundbreaking new techniques in energy economics with emerging sources 
            of real-time grid data, that vision of energy choice has become a reality. Ordinary 
            people can now have a say in how the electricity sector works like never before.

            At WattTime, we spend our days crafting never-before-seen tools to keep making energy 
            choice easier, cheaper, and more empowering. We are constantly pushing the envelope by 
            employing (and contributing to) the newest research in sustainability, behavioral 
            economics, and hardware design. 
        </p> 
        <p class="text-info">
            Want to help? If you share our passion for placing the power of energy choice in people's 
            hands, please <a href="{% url 'contact' %}" class="btn btn-small btn-info">get in touch!</a>
            We are a small but passionate team of economists, software developers, designers, and 
            cleantech professionals based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Particularly if you are 
            an energy industry professional, front-end or mobile developer, cultural entrepreneur, 
            or mechanical engineer, we would love to hear from you.
