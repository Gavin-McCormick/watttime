<div class="well faq-categories"><h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<p style="font-size:16px">WattTime is in no way an incorporated entity, it is the project of individuals collaborating of their own accord to test a concept for personal use. Particularly if the project proceeds to incorporation and/or commercialization, the following terms will almost certainly change. Should these terms change, WattTime team members will attempt to notify in a timely manner any active users for whom we have contact information. But we cannot offer any guarantee that we will do so. Any person accessing this website or participating in the accompanying text message notification system (“users”), by so doing, indicate acceptance of the following Agreement. WattTime team members reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement at any time.</p>
